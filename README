nemesys

nemesys is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Python programming language. I
know that PyPy exists; The point of this project is only my personal learning
and enjoyment.

This project is what happens when someone who has never written a compiler or
taken a computer languages or compilers class writes a compiler. The goals of
this project are fun and learning, not necessarily to contribute anything of
value to the world. If you're a student looking for an example of well-designed
compiler, this is not such an example.

Here's what nemesys does:
- Function calls and control flow statements like if, for, while, etc.
- Fast integer math.
- Floating-point math.
- Strings, lists, and tuples.
- Non-inherited classes.
- Refcounted garbage collection.
- Custom class destructors (__del__).
- Exceptions.
- Lambdas and non-closure private functions.
- Function polymorphism.

Here's what nemesys doesn't do yet, but will in the future:
- Dicts and sets.
- Variadic functions.
- Recursion.
- Class inheritance.
- Decorators.
- Most built-in functions.
- Generators and coroutines.
- Magic methods on classes (except __init__ and __del__, which are implemented).

Here's what nemesys doesn't do yet, but might in the future:
- Closures.
- Return statements inside finally blocks.
- Support the CPython C API.
- Optimize its generated assembly code.
- Build and run on architectures other than AMD64.

Here's what nemesys will probably never be able to do:
- Assign arbitrary attributes to objects after construction time.
- Polymorphic variables within a scope (except to/from None).
- Metaclasses.
- Negative exponents for integer bases. Just do 1/(a**b) instead.

Have fun. Don't complain to me if you run this and it breaks your computer.
